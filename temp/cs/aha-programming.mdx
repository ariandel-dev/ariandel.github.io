과한 추상화는 가독성을 현저히 떨어뜨린다.   
협업을 힘들게하고 유지보수가 어렵다.

Write Everything Twice.

In that same codebase I mentioned above, there was some **over-abstraction that was even more harmful than duplication**. It was AngularJS code and for several AngularJS controllers, the code passed this to a function which would monkey-patch methods and properties onto this in a way enhancing the controller instance with certain abilities.

적절한 레벨의 추상화를 할 자신이 없다면 우선 중복을 허용하자. 그편이 낫다.

#### AHA

Avoid Hasty Abstractions.
