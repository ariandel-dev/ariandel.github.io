```javascript
export abstract class Methods extends EventEmitter<WebClientEvent>
```
이러면 api 요청이 반환되는 비동기 함수에서 emit을해주고

사용하는 입장에서는 on을 통해서 이벤트를 받아서 처리할 수 있다.
```javascript
if (retrySec !== undefined) {
  this.emit(WebClientEvent.RATE_LIMITED, retrySec, { url, body });
  if (this.rejectRateLimitedCalls) {
    throw new AbortError(rateLimitedErrorWithDelay(retrySec));
  }
  this.logger.info(`API Call failed due to rate limiting. Will retry in ${retrySec} seconds.`);
  // pause the request queue and then delay the rejection by the amount of time in the retry header
  this.requestQueue.pause();
  // NOTE: if there was a way to introspect the current RetryOperation and know what the next timeout
  // would be, then we could subtract that time from the following delay, knowing that it the next
  // attempt still wouldn't occur until after the rate-limit header has specified. an even better
  // solution would be to subtract the time from only the timeout of this next attempt of the
  // RetryOperation. this would result in the staying paused for the entire duration specified in the
  // header, yet this operation not having to pay the timeout cost in addition to that.
  await delay(retrySec * 1000);
  // resume the request queue and throw a non-abort error to signal a retry
  this.requestQueue.start();
  // TODO: We may want to have more detailed info such as team_id, params except tokens, and so on.
  throw new Error(`A rate limit was exceeded (url: ${url}, retry-after: ${retrySec})`);
}
```
node에서 제공하는것보다 eventemitter3 를 사용하는게 에러 핸들링 측면에서 유리하다.

( on으로 구독하지 않으면 emit 할때 에러를 던지지 않는다 )
